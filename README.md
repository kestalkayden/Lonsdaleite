# Lonsdaleite Mod for 1.16

Lonsdaleite is a standalone mod for Minecraft 1.16 (Fabric). It adds Lonsdaleite tools and armor which are a tier above diamond. It's an alternative to Netherite. 

## Downloads

As a general warning, Remember to backup your world before installing new versions! Though really, it's a small mod and shouldn't break anything.

## Why this?

I created this as I do not particularly enjoy the nether (even with 1.16 nether update). This is a separate direction than Netherite and it requires a hefty price in Diamond to not only craft, but to repair as well. Be sure to make good use out of enchantments when utilizing these tools.
