# Lonsdaleite Mod (Fabric) (1.16-pre3)

## Intro

The Lonsdaleite Mod for Minecraft 1.16 (Fabric) aims to add another tier of tools/armor above Diamond and improving over some aspects of Netherite. There are a few steps when creating Lonsdaleite which require plenty of diamond, obsidian, and blocks of coal. This process is then fed through to a blast furnace to create a Lonsdaleite Gem.

## Why this?

I created this as I do not particularly enjoy the nether (even with 1.16 nether update). This is a separate direction than Netherite and it requires a hefty price in Diamond to not only craft, but to repair as well. Be sure to make good use out of enchantments when utilizing these tools.
